# Data Science & Analytics Project Portfolio

## About Me & My Transition
Hello! I'm Aarya Mehta, an analytics professional with a strong foundation in data science.

After extensive experience in data science, I discovered my true passionâ€”making data actionable to drive business results. This realization led me to specialize in analytics, where I blend technical rigor and business strategy for maximum impact.

## Why I Chose Analytics
- Transforming complex modeling into practical, business-driven solutions
- Collaborating closely with business leaders and stakeholders
- Focusing on cross-functional problem-solving for tangible business value
- Technical strengths in R, Python, machine learning, and statistics
