# Restaurant Recommender System

A data science project that demonstrates intelligent restaurant recommendations using machine learning techniques and comprehensive restaurant data analysis.

## Project Overview

This project builds a restaurant recommendation system that analyzes restaurant metadata and customer reviews to provide personalized dining suggestions. The system leverages data science techniques including natural language processing, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering to deliver accurate recommendations based on user preferences and dining history.

## Features

- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Uses restaurant metadata and customer reviews for intelligent suggestions
- **Multiple Filtering Approaches**: Implements both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques
- **Review Analysis**: Processes customer reviews using NLP to extract sentiment and key features
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: Complete walkthrough with data visualization and model evaluation
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Includes restaurant names, metadata, and customer review data
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amehta7850/Data-Science-projects.git
   cd "Data-Science-projects/Restaurant Recommender"
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Restaurant Recommender System.ipynb"
   ```

4. **Run the cells** to see the complete analysis and recommendation system in action

## Sample Recommendation

The system can provide recommendations like:
- *"Based on your preference for Italian cuisine and highly-rated restaurants, we recommend 'Bella Vista' - a 4.8-star Italian restaurant known for authentic pasta dishes and excellent service."*

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
- **Natural Language Processing**: Review text analysis
