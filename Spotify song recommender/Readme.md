# Spotify Song Recommender

A data science project that builds a music recommendation system using Spotify data and machine learning techniques to suggest songs based on user preferences and listening patterns.

## Project Overview

This project implements a song recommendation system that analyzes music features and user listening patterns to provide personalized song suggestions. The system uses various machine learning algorithms to identify similarities between songs and recommend tracks that align with user preferences.

## Features

- **Content-based filtering**: Recommends songs based on audio features and characteristics
- **Collaborative filtering**: Uses user listening patterns and preferences
- **Genre analysis**: Incorporates genre information for improved recommendations
- **Data visualization**: Provides insights into music patterns and recommendation performance

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
spotipy (for Spotify API integration)
```

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter spotipy
```

## Datasets

This project uses two main datasets:

1. **genres_v2.csv**: Contains genre classifications and characteristics for different music styles
2. **playlists.csv**: Contains playlist data with song features, user preferences, and listening patterns

Both datasets should be placed in the same directory as the notebook for proper execution.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amehta7850/Data-Science-projects.git
   cd "Data-Science-projects/Spotify song recommender"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Or install packages individually as listed above)

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open and run the notebook**:
   - Navigate to the Spotify song recommender notebook
   - Run all cells sequentially
   - Follow the step-by-step analysis and model building process

## Expected Outputs

When you run the notebook, you can expect to see:

- **Data Exploration**: Statistical summaries and visualizations of the music datasets
- **Feature Analysis**: Correlation matrices and feature importance plots
- **Model Performance**: Accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and recommendation quality scores
- **Recommendation Results**: Sample song recommendations with similarity scores
- **Visualizations**: Charts showing genre distributions, audio feature patterns, and model comparisons
