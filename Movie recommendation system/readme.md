Movie Recommendation System
This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for building a content-based movie recommendation engine using real-world movie metadata. The project leverages data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning to predict and suggest movies similar to a given title.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user-selected movies and metadata features. It uses data from TMDb (The Movie Database) and employs techniques such as feature extraction, text vectorization, and similarity calculations.

Datasets Used
tmdb_5000_movies.csv: Contains metadata for over 5,000 movies (genres, overview, keywords, ratings, etc.).

tmdb_5000_credits.csv: Contains detailed cast and crew information for the same movies.

Notebook Workflow
In the main Jupyter notebook, you’ll find:

Data Loading and Exploration: Initial data cleaning and inspection.

Feature Engineering: Extraction of important features such as cast, crew, genres, and keywords.

Text Vectorization: Use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to convert text features into vectors.

Similarity Computation: Calculation of cosine similarity between movies for content-based recommendations.

Recommendation Engine: Selection and ranking of similar movies for a target title.

Evaluation and Visualization: Sample recommendations and result analysis.

Key Techniques
Pandas data manipulation

Feature extraction and transformation

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis

Cosine similarity for recommendation

Data visualization (where applicable)
